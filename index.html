        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
        the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.
